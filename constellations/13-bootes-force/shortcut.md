|      | Hoard units on B    | Repeat (all)↠B |                                                                                                                                        |
| 1:30 | Lose A and C        | Wait.          |                                                                                                                                        |
| 2:00 | D⇧3 and E⇧3         | B/2→D, B/2→E   | Split the units from B in half and send each one horizontally through the force field, then near their respective planets, and ambush. |
|      | Take entire top row |                | Play like a normal game to take all 6 plaents in the top row.                                                                                                               |
| 3:15 | F⇧2                 | Repeat (all)↠F | One of the other players should be beating the other. Take their side planet on the bottom.                                            |
| 4:45 | A⇧3                 | Repeat (all)↠A |                                                                                                                                        |
|      | Win                 |                | You should have more than enough units for this.                                                                                       |

## Stats

- Effort taken to beat NOVA time: ≈10 attempts
- Best time: 4:08.1

## Notes

- ⁴ I hoard all units on C until one of the other players attacks, then immediately move all units to B. This is intended to delay attacks from other players, though I don't know if it works.
- ⁸ You may need to target units to the far to the side. Targeting F directly loses units into the middle due to the force field.
